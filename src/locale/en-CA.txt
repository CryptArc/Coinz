# This is the default language file. To make a file in your language, simply copy this file and
# replace the text lines. Please keep in mind any words enclosed in %'s are used internally.
# You can move them to another spot within the text but remember to type it exactly as it was

# All lines starting with # are ignored, all blank lines are also ignored.

# Feel free to submit the language files you create to me, and I'll include them in future versions.
# I will not keep them up to date though, as I only speak english, and google translate isn't
# 100% reliable.
